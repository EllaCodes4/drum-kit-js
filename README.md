# drum-kit-js
 A keyboard drum set, built with Javascript.

# Lessons Learned
Every key on a computer's keyboard is associated with a number (for example, the spacebar is #32). 
We can use those numbers to program a drum set to play various drum sounds when certain "keys" (letters) are pressed on the keyboard. 
I learned about keyboard events such as "keydown", "keyup" and created a Play Sound function that played when certain letters were pressed down. 
I learned how to play audio using the function .play() and how to add an event listener to listen for the "transitionend" event.

This project was built for fun, as part of the 30 Days of Javascript Challenge!
